Scenario 1: Dazed and Confused
Student: I’m feeling very overwhelmed by all of the material in this program. 
It seems like every time I learn something new, I forget how to do everything 
else from before that. Right now I can’t even seem to figure out how to
 finish the first project. 
It’s not supposed to be this hard, is it? What do I do?

Your reflection
It's okay to feel confused..you're learning a lot! 
Let's see if we can figure this out bit by bit.
What often helps me is thinking through the problem before
working on it. Let's make placeholders for the problem first 
so we tackle it in a general way, 
and then we can tackle the problem in a specific way.
Also, let's create a schedule based on your time to make sure we have enough time 
to go through everything thoroughly and ask questions, so you don't feel overwhelmed and 
understand the material completely.

My thought process for this that you reassure the student that their feelings are 
valid, but to take that feeling of being overwhelmed and learn how to overcome it
by solving little problems (breaking a big problem into small problems we can analyze
and solve), which can build up the student's self-confidence, and strengthen their skills.
Also, creating a schedule also helps give the student control, because they have a clear 
idea of how they can finish within deadlines that they have personally set, based on their 
personal schedule (sometimes a large project and a two month deadline is difficult to anticipate
as opposed to breaking down the tasks into accomplishments by week of the larger project eg. 
I shoud be done with data cleaning by week one, etc)
By the time they have done a snowball of solving the smaller parts of the problem, they would
have a better idea of how to tackle the entire material. 

Scenario 2: Mean Means
Student: I’m not sure how to do this. 
The question asks for the mean of the following numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.
How do I get the mean? How is that different from the average?
 
Your reflection
Let's see. How would you go about getting the mean? 
We should be able to find how to do this online. 
It looks like they're looking for the mathematical mean and average, as they are very 
specific in mentioning a series of numbers.
It's important to be specific about what you're looking for when searching
about how to solve a problem. This also improves with time. 
Were you able to find a general formula for this? What has been your source of 
information/ research thus far? Could you walk me through what you have so far?

Scenario 3: Mindset Reset
You witness the following conversation between two students (Student A and Student B)
in a Udacity community space (e..g the forums or Slack). Please assume
here that Student A and Student B have similar levels of experience with programming:
 

Student A: I’m trying to teach my friend how to code, 
but I’m not sure I'm doing a very good job. I’ve never really taught before!
I think the most difficult 
thing so far has been not knowing what to do if I don’t know the 
answer to a question my friend asks. Should I take my best guess? 
Should I look it up with her? How do other people who have taught 
or mentored handled moments like this?

Student B: If your friend has questions you don’t know the answer to, 
are you sure you should be mentoring them? I’ve never run into that
situation when I’ve taught because I’ve been a developer for so 
long and know so much.

Your reflection
Everyone has to start somewhere! How do you think I became a mentor? 
I am still learning, and we should all continue to learn throughout our career. 
It makes us better at what we do. You can still be helpful, even if you think you 
don't know enough. If you're not confident, remember to do research and practice, and 
also reach out to others for help. I can help you with a list of resources that have 
been helpful to me. Maybe you could both start a shared group of resources, which 
can grow as you continue to be developers. 

Scenario 4: It's just too much
Student: This is all so frustrating! I don’t think I can figure any of this out. 
I’ve gone over and over the videos in this course, but I’m just not getting it.
Every time I sit down to work on the project, I just can’t
seem to remember what to do next. I guess I’m just not cut out for engineering.

Your reflection
Don't give up! Let's take a break today and tackle this again! 
We'll start tackling a small problem first, and build up your confidence, 
and then we'll work up to the more difficult ones!
Engineering is challenging, but you're cut out for this, and you can do it!
It just takes time and it's better to take the time to understand everything,
ask questions and struggle, because that's how we all learned! Keep going
and feel free to reach out to us for support and encouragement! 


Student: Every time I ask for help at Udacity, mentors just confuse me 
and won’t give me the answers I need. 
If I can’t figure something out, tell me the solution!
 What is wrong with you people?
 
Your reflection
I'm here to support you, as are your fellow mentors at Udacity. We're here to point 
you in the right direction, so that you can learn the benefits of research skills 
and how to learn. It's an important skill that will make you a very valuable developer,
both individually and as a member of a team. Problems you face as a programmer day 
to day won't always be easy, so the Nanodegree is excellent at teaching
you how to problem solve and work through these problems, and give you
valuable skills to take throughout your career. It's quite valuable in that
way, and you'll be much more successful in your career this way! 

Scenario 6: Margot's Strawberries
A student reaches out to you for help on the following problem:

Margot loves strawberries and wants to buy as many as she 
can with the $8 she has in her pocket.
 If a pound of strawberries costs $7 and there are 18 strawberries in a pound, 
how many strawberries can she buy total? Hint:
 She can’t buy part of a strawberry :)
 
Let's see..this is a tricky one! 
Let's make a list of all the things they tell us, 
and what they want us to find, and see if we can make a connection between the two. 
That usually does it. 
Let's start small; step by step with this one so we don't get overwhelmed!


Student: Okay, so I have s = # strawberries, 
c = cost per strawberry in dollars, c = 7/18, and 8 = c * s. But now what?

Mentor prompt #2: How would you guide the student through the next
 stage of this problem? Write your response to their latest message and/or a script 
 of how you think the conversation would continue, and then tell us why you 
 responded this way.
 
Your reflection
Let's see if we can use the cost of one and the other information
they give us to find the total cost. How do you think you'd start doing this?
It looks like they gave us a formula for finding what they want us to solve.
 
I responded this way so they can get used to solving problems the same way.
By talking out loud and breaking into smaller, more logical steps.

Student: I have s = 144/7. Is that it?

Mentor prompt #3: How would you guide the student through the end 
of the interaction? Write your response to their latest message
 and/or a script of how you think the conversation would continue,
 and then tell us why you responded this way.
 
Could you walk me through how you got that? If the answer is correct, 
you should be able to run it through Udacity's test and it should pass. 
If it doesn't work, I'd like to walk through the process you used for solving it. 
Sometimes you've almost got it, but it's something small; like 
forgetting to round up or giving an int instead of a float. 
The test will give you useful feedback,
so remember to use it and read what it says! 
It looks like you're pretty close...
That usually does the trick!
