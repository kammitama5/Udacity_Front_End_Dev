You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  <sup> for subscript
  <strike> for crossing off
  <hr> for footer page break
  html margins without css <body style="margin:30px;padding:5px">
  * What has been easy?
  generally breaking things into bits
  * What has been difficult?
  remembering how to do images and links..I'm used to markdown
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  trying to figure it out myself, and then googling. But also trying to apply reason as to how to remember.
  I've started dividing things into chunks first, then going from there.
